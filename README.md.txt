Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java
Overview
This Java program implements a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It consists of two separate programs, allowing players to either play against another human player or against an AI opponent.

Features
Play with Another Human Player
Two-Player Mode: Engage in a traditional Tic-Tac-Toe match against another human player.
Interactive Gameplay: Experience turn-based gameplay, allowing both players to make their moves.
Valid Move Checking: Ensure that moves are within the bounds of the 3x3 game board and on empty spaces.
Game Outcome: Announce the winner or declare the game as a draw when it concludes.
Play with an AI Opponent
AI Player Mode: Challenge your strategic skills by playing against an AI opponent.
Random AI Moves: The AI player generates random but valid moves to keep the game interesting.
Interactive Gameplay: As the human player, enter your moves via the console.
Game Outcome: Like the two-player mode, the game announces the result when it ends, whether a player wins or it's a draw.

Usage
To play the game with another human player, run the PlayWithHuman program. To play against the AI opponent, run the PlayWithComputer program.

Customization
You can easily customize the game by modifying the code. For example, you can add features such as a win counter, difficulty levels for the AI player, or additional error handling for invalid input.

How to Run
To run the game, ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Compile and run the program using the following commands:

javac PlayWithHuman.java
java PlayWithHuman

or

javac PlayWithComputer.java
